Patch 7.1.5 Ready!

This is my UI which is mainly focused around me, a Warlock Gnome :), however I will add other profiles for most, if not all of the addons that are being used for my UI.

My UI is based around 2560x1440, 1920x1080 or 1366x768 resolution, although it does scale with all other resolutions I've tested including 4K and also over multiple screens using EyeFinity / nVidia Surround.

You can check out my UI in action here during a Low Leveled Dungeon Run
