This is my UI which is mainly focused around me, a Warlock Gnome :), however I will add other profiles for most, if not all of the addons that are being used for my UI.

My UI is based around** 2560x1440**, **1920x1080** or **1366x768** resolution, although it does scale with all other resolutions I've tested including **4K** and also over multiple screens using **[EyeFinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Eyefinity) / [nVidia Surround](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-monitor#Nvidia_Surround)**.
